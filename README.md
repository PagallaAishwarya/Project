# Project
This project is called Repo named by Aishwarya Pagalla
Proposal by Aishwarya
Design and Requirments - Aishwwarya
this is an Android Application, Repos Application  is a  file hosting service, like github, We can share files of any type. One can only see that the file exists but not the contents of it . Here I am using technique of encryption, RSA to encrypt contents of the files. If someone tries to open the  files it just shows encrypted ,unlike github.
